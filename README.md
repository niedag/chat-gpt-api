For the Exception Catching for Talk To GPT Model
completion["choices"]: the choices field contains an array of potential completions ranked by the model.

```return completion["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]```  means returning the choice 1 model

Message: information related to a specific choice made by the model (the container for metadata and content) 

Content: the actual text or information generated by the model for that specific message

For chat completion responses, only **gpt-4-1106-preview** and **gpt-3.5-turbo-1106** will return 

**You must pay $5 to the AI gods for Tier 1 in order to use gpt4 or dalle-3 requests.
It is $0.04 per image for Dalle3 and $0.01 per GPT4 call**
